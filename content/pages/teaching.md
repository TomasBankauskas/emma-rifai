      My approach to teaching is informed by my commitment to education as a
      collaborative enterprise best pursued through pedagogies that involve
      every student in the learning process. As an educator, I am invested in
      developing dynamic classrooms utilizing creative pedagogies that inspire
      student engagement with me, assigned materials, and each other. As a
      result, I view each class as an opportunity to generate a learning
      community where students, working together, are inspired to take ownership
      of assigned materials and class topics through thoughtful discussion and
      analysis.


      One of the ways I encourage students to take ownership of class topics is
      by empowering them with both theory and methodology at the beginning of
      each semester. For example, when I teach my course “Women and Religion in
      America Today,” students spend the first few class sessions reading and
      analyzing key concepts in theories of lived religion and ethnographic
      methodology. They then mobilize what they have learned as they explore
      course content throughout the rest of the semester by addressing various
      ways assigned primary and secondary source materials utilize these
      theoretical and methodological approaches. When writing their
      summary-analysis papers, which are designed to prepare them for our
      seminar-style class sessions, students address what they see as the
      strengths and limitations of the assigned author’s theoretical and
      methodological approaches and support their claims with textual
      references. This encourages students to actively and critically engage
      with assigned materials beyond simply learning content.


      I am committed to facilitating seminar-style class sessions that are
      flexibly structured so that students can focus on topics from the assigned
      readings that they find relevant, challenging, or confusing. After working
      with students to form a solid foundation as a large group, I usually then
      facilitate paired or small group work to explore what they are learning in
      new and synergetic ways. Memorably, during one “Modern Religion and
      Culture” class session, we used sidewalk chalk outside on a beautifully
      sunny day to map historical timelines in preparation for an upcoming exam.
      By the end of our session, students were collaborating to construct visual
      representations of class materials in colorful, creative ways—including
      timelines in the shapes of maps, umbrellas and balloons—that we then ended
      up photographing for reference later as they prepared for their final
      exam.


      I like to have semesters culminate in a series of peer-led mini lessons
      that students are responsible for crafting and executing with their
      classmates. Each lesson incorporates primary and secondary source
      materials, a lecture or activity, and a facilitated group discussion. In
      one iteration of my “Women and Religion in America Today” course, there
      was a lesson on yoga and cultural appropriation in the United States that
      was particularly compelling in that it asked fellow students to think
      about their own compliance with culturally appropriative practices
      embedded in an activity that nearly everyone had participated in. I find
      that concluding the semester with these


      mini lessons reinforces for students not only the importance of being
      mindful of theory and methodology but also, more importantly, their own
      potential for being contributing members of their academic communities.




      In recognition of my success in teaching at The University of Iowa, I
      received the Rev. Louis P. Penningroth Award for excellence in teaching
      and mentoring from the department of religious studies in 2018. My
      effectiveness in the classroom is also attested to by my course
      evaluations. Statistically, I have been rated among the highest performing
      instructors both in my department and in the College of Liberal Arts
      Sciences more broadly. One student from my “Digital Media and Religion”
      course commented: “This has been my favorite class so far! Each class we
      are presented with new ideas and ways in which to view the world. I have
      thoroughly enjoyed listening to both the instructor and my classmates’
      ideas on the topics covered in class.”




      In all of my roles as an educator—as a teacher, a mentor, an advocate, and
      a facilitator—I aim to empower students with the knowledge that they are
      capable of not only contributing to but actually shaping the contours of
      their academic experiences. By the end of our time together, students
      leave my classes believing they are valuable and contributing members of
      their learning communities, both on campus and more broadly.
