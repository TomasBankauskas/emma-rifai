      My dissertation, entitled “Embodying the Secular: Power, Bodies, and
      American Secularism,” argues that American secularism is best understood
      as fundamentally embodied and that this embodiment is made plain in
      contemporary techniques of body management. I find that the body is a
      foundational site where we can see the co-constitutive nature of the
      “secular” and the “religious” emerge as well as the scope and contours of
      their entangled ontologies. This entanglement is particularly clear when
      we consider how American secularism is imbued with the same Protestant
      values, including commitments to individualism, self-control, and
      optimization, that orient American cultural life more broadly. 


      Through case studies on direct-to-consumer genetic testing, biohacking,
      and the pro-ana movement, I explore the tensions between the discourses
      and practices that seek to sustain American secularism and the bodies that
      confound these attempts by expanding and contracting the field of
      possibility from which the contemporary American subject emerges.
      Intervening in religious studies, cultural studies, and gender studies,
      this project demonstrates just how central embodiment is to the
      construction of American culture today.
