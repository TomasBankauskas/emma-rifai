      American secularism is a pervasive and utterly inescapable aspect of life
      in the United States today. To participate in American public life is to
      engage with the particular secularism of the United States. And to engage
      with the particular secularism of the United States is to perpetuate a
      Protestant privilege embedded in the very fabric of this secularism on
      every scale, from institutions to individuals. While a number of scholars
      have attended to America’s particular form of secularism as it circulates
      in institutions like law, politics, and economics, less attention has been
      paid to how individuals embody American secularism in their daily lives.
      My research attends to this gap by exploring how gender, religion, and
      secularism intersect in everyday practices at the site of the body.


      My dissertation, entitled “Embodying the Secular: Power, Bodies, and
      American Secularism,” argues that American secularism is best understood
      as fundamentally embodied and that this embodiment is made plain in
      contemporary techniques of body management. It finds that the body is a
      foundational site where it is possible to see the co-constitutive nature
      of the secular and the religious emerge as well as the scope and contours
      of their entangled ontologies. This entanglement is particularly clear
      when considering how American secularism is imbued with the same
      Protestant values, including commitments to individualism, self-control,
      and optimization, that orient American cultural life more broadly. Through
      case studies on direct-to-consumer genetic testing, biohacking, and the
      pro-ana movement, this dissertation explores the tensions between the
      discourses and practices that seek to sustain American secularism and the
      bodies that confound these attempts by expanding and contracting the field
      of possibility from which the contemporary American subject emerges.


      My first case study explores the logics of direct-to-consumer genetic
      testing and the role this practice plays in contemporary subject
      production. Through an analysis of the published marketing and media of
      at-home genetic testing companies like 23andMe, I reveal how American
      individualism is refracted through genetic science and digital
      technologies at the site of the disciplined body. My second case study
      analyzes the rhetorics and practices of the hyper-masculinized biohacking
      movement and how this movement mobilizes and capitalizes on the particular
      logics of optimization. In this chapter, I consider how entrepreneurs like
      Tim Ferriss, Dave Asprey, and Ben Greenfield peddle biohacking techniques
      in ways that privilege particularly white, male, healthy, and wealthy
      bodies as a new form of biopower. My third case study demonstrates how
      self-control is managed in the online pro-ana movement through daily
      practices that sustain and diminish life and liveliness in abject,
      gendered bodies. In this chapter, I analyze the popular pro-ana site
      MyPancakeAddiction and track individuals embodying pro-ana digital culture
      through performances of a shared value system that reflect a particularly
      Protestant, and feminized, orientation toward the self and the body even
      as this movement is villainized in popular culture.


      Intervening in religious studies, cultural studies, and gender studies,
      this project makes plain the ways in which American secularism is embodied
      and thus corrects a longstanding disregard for the bodily techniques that
      sustain public life in the United States. It is not arbitrary or
      insignificant that Protestant values and American secularism are
      co-constituted at the site of the gendered body through popular body
      management practices. Indeed, the continued daily performances of American
      secularism and hegemonic Protestantism by gendered bodies through


      popular body management practices reveals just how central embodiment is
      to the construction of American culture today.




      My larger research agenda concerns the religio-secular assemblages that
      shape everyday life in contemporary America at the site of the body. I
      have a recent refereed article out with the Journal of Religion, Media,
      and Digital Culture entitled “Digital Waistlands: Pro-Ana Communities,
      Religion, and Embodiment,” which explores how women embody religio-secular
      values through their performances of pro-ana digital culture.
      Additionally, Religion Compass has recently published my peer-reviewed
      essay entitled “Weighty Matter(s): Religion, Secularism, and American
      Weight Loss Culture,” which summarizes the state of this fairly new field
      of research in religious studies. Finally, in addition to three upcoming
      conference presentations, I am developing a book proposal based on my
      dissertation that I will be prepared to discuss with editors in the
      spring.


      My next research project considers the early nineteenth century American
      diet reform movements that flourished alongside the rapid urbanization,
      industrialization, and emergence of an identifiable print public in the
      United States. These movements not only linked body size with morality and
      connected body regulation to the rise of American consumer culture but
      also worked to establish hierarchies of race, sexuality, gender, and
      class. While much of the work on early American weight loss movements has
      centered on Sylvester Graham and his followers, I am exploring another
      trend: the water cure, a movement that was largely dominated by women in
      the United States. Most hydropathic spas were run by women and functioned
      as epicenters for dress reform, temperance, and the women’s rights
      movement. Indeed, the first National Dress Reform Association meeting was
      held at the Glenhaven Water-Cure. Through an analysis of this trend’s
      primary periodical Water-Cure Journal, published between 1845 and 1857, I
      will trace changing attitudes toward the body in light of the personal ads
      it ran that included height and weight specifications for prospective
      partners. Because other preferences like political orientation and
      religious affiliation were also listed, I expect to find evidence of
      shifting attitudes about religion as well. A careful reading and analysis
      of the Water-Cure Journal will offer important interventions in our
      understanding of evolving orientations not only toward the body but also
      towards religion, spirituality, and the increasingly “secular” imperative
      to count calories from the mid to late nineteenth century in the United
      States.


      Broadly, my work is an interdisciplinary engagement with themes of
      Protestantism and secularism in America; critical theory and religion;
      religion, food, and the body; and gender, religion, and culture. I am
      committed to exploring the intersections of religion and secularism in the
      contemporary United States as they manifest as embodied practices in the
      everyday. This work offers important contributions to the fields of
      religious studies, cultural studies, and gender studies by shifting the
      primary unit of analysis from populations to the individual and by
      considering how the individual, gendered body mediates the secular and the
      religious through daily actions and behaviors.
